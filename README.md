This is a Business Case study in which I created a Power BI dashboard to analyze the revenue driving key metrics and aseesed performance for our clientâ€™s top brands.
I performed an in-depth analysis on how the margins waterfall stacked-up and shrank inspite of the increased sales through the cycle.
Deeply analyzed key elements like Sales, Sales Cost Margin, Gross Profit, Key Metrics Overview.   
Generated over 25 drill-through, drill-down, parameterized, linked reports in Power BI using m-query and DAX operations.
 Implemented an automated data auditing process for sales department resulting in 15% increased redundancy elimination rate.
