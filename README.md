This is a Business Case study in which I created a Power BI dashboard to analyze the revenue driving key metrics and assessed performance for our clientâ€™s top brands.
I performed an in-depth analysis on how the margins waterfall stacked-up and shrank inspite of the increased sales through the cycle.
I deeply analyzed KPIs like Sales - per Customer, per Transaction, per Brand, Sales Cost Margin, Gross Profit, Net Cost, Sales Incentive, and Product Mix.    
I generated over 25 drill-through, drill-down, parameterized, linked reports in Power BI using m-query and DAX operations.
Finally, I implemented an automated data auditing process for sales department resulting in a 15% increased redundancy elimination rate.
